//All For One

//Created an api that contained multiple endpoints reflecting each of our previous C# MiniChallenges. Each has their own controller and service folder. Included are: 

//Hello World
//Asking Questions
//Adding Two Numbers
//MadLib
//Odd Or Even
//Reverse It(Alphanumeric)
//Reverse it (Numbers Only)
//Magic 8 Ball
//Guess It
//Restaurant Picker
 
 //Peer Review - Brandon Estrada - Your endpoints are working for your API, I am able to get an endpoint back from your Azure link. Code looks clean and everything functions properly. I did notice a small issue with MCSevenChallenge, the reversing numbers only. There isn't data validation for inputs that are non numbers. Other than that, everything else looks good!
